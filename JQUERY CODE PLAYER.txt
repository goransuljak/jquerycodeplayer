1.First I style html 
2.I create logo, in div header,
3.and then div of buttons 4 of them for html css js and output
note: I make sure class name is similar to js variable cause othervise it wont 
work.. example : toggle-button wont work, and toggleButton will work.
4.Each button goes by id of html, css, js, and output
5.Then I style everything in CSS to look nice and neat
6.Instead of hovering buttons in CSS I will practice in JQuery
7.Which means $("").hover(function ()...
$(this).css("highlightedButton").
8.api.jquery.com is a site for jquery documentation, we can find over there
hover events and much more.
9.Then we apply in HTML class of active to buton of output and html
10.Then style active in CSS
11.We create class in CSS and then we addClass("") we toggle class we created in CSS
12.And when we hover over we wont to removeClass("").
13.Also when something is clicked we want to toggle class of active so what we
click turns into active color.
14.Also we would remove css class we created by remove so there is only color
of active we styled left.
15.Now we must create html and output area's first we create area div
16.For html we can use textarea, style it in CSS
17.We can use $(window).height() - $("#header").height())
for textarea width and height, we also dont wont it resizable, so we can use in css
resize: none;
18.Now we add our output but this time we use iframe, we will use same name so 
we easier display them example: outputPanel, or htmlPanel, also will add class
for each of lets say "panel" so we can style all of them in CSS
19.To style them in JS to float nicely we can do same as before but this time with
width 
$(".panel").width(($(window).width() / 2)
20.Now we need to change HTML of an iFrame with Jquery, we can look for asnwer on
stackoverflow
example code: $("iframe").contents().find("html").html($("#htmlPanel).val());
now it updates from htmlPanel that we created in HTML
21.Now we need event that updates text we change in textarea and example is:
$("textarea").on("change keyup paste", function() {
and when that happens we want this from above update 
      $("iframe").contents().find("html").html($("#htmlPanel).val());
}
22.Now all we got to do is css panel and javascript panel, we want that hidden so
we add class and style in CSS display:none
23.To get atribute that is clicked we would use $(this).attr("") + "Panel"
24.Then we count elements with number of classes, so if we add hidden we can count
numbers that are hidden.
25.We can google jquery counting elments with a class, so if use something like
$(".yourclass").length here you can see how jquery is easy
26.Then we create variable of active panels 
example : let numberOfActivePanels = 4 - $(".hidden").length;
27.Manually put our html to style our javascript 
28.Create function updateOutput and that would just do output, and we can call it
anywhere.
29.Run string as javascript with eval function with an iframe
30.And then javascript can update text instead of alerting it we do this by
document.getElementById("p").innerHTML = "HELLO LJUDI";
